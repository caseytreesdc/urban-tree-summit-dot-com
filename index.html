      <h4>Urban Foresters: Stories from the Front Lines</h4>
      <h5>Leslie Berckes - Executive Director of the Urban and Community Forestry Society (UCFS)</h5>
      <p class="description">Urban Forestry is a growing profession of people who make daily tree stewardship decisions.
        These are the front-line folks who make trees happen, the people without whom our collective tree goals will not
        be met! We need our urban foresters to feel confident and fully competent in their tree care decisions. However,
        it’s a tough job. Extreme weather, wearing too many hats, municipal politics…it can be a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="description">In this presentation, Executive Director of the Urban and Community Forestry Society (UCFS)
        Leslie Berckes will share some stories from UCFS Members who are creatively meeting these challenges and finding
        new opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="description">UCFS is the professional membership home for urban foresters and gives voice to their
        concerns, challenges, and triumphs. Leslie will share case studies that reveal the novel solutions and
        innovative practices that UCFS members from across the country are putting into practice. What is the “urban
        forestry multiverse”? How can we best support the DMV’s urban forestry professionals through the current urban
        forestry inflection point?</p>

      <h4>Selection in the City: A Nursery Supply Chain Analysis Explores Domestic Selection of Baltimore’s Trees</h4>
      <h5>Dr. Nancy Falxa Sonti, PhD - Research Ecologist - Northern Research Station at USDA Forest Service</h5>
      <p class="description">Cities across the world are pursuing ambitious tree planting initiatives in order to
        enhance provision of critical ecosystem services. To maintain desirable traits, planted trees are typically
        clones and/or cultivars chosen by local nurseries, and have limited genetic diversity among them. Many trees
        sourced from local nurseries have undergone artificial selection, which is the selection of traits that are
        desired by the breeder. In addition, urban trees also pass through successive selective filters of preference by
        the nursery industry selecting which trees to propagate and by urban foresters, landscape architects,
        contractors, and landowners selecting which trees to plant, in a process of “domestic selection.” In order to
        characterize domestic selection in the Baltimore, MD, USA metropolitan area, we examined the processes of
        selecting and disseminating trees from the horticultural industry to urban tree planting organizations and
        private development projects. We employed a semi-structured interview protocol with each actor in the supply
        chain network in order to determine the key factors that affect their decisions and behaviors at each stage in
        the supply chain. Interview questions included: factors affecting their decisions about which tree species or
        cultivars to grow, select, or plant; concerns about species and/or genetic diversity; concerns about climate
        and/or pest resilience; their knowledge about the source and methods of propagation for the trees they work
        with; and key trends in their industry over time.</p>

        <p>Nancy Sonti is a Research Ecologist with the US Forest Service Northern Research Station. She is based at the
          Baltimore Field Station, where she works as an interdisciplinary researcher studying urban social-ecological
          systems. Nancy works to build collaboration between academics, community groups, and government agencies
          through the Baltimore Urban Waters Federal Partnership, the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, the Northeast Urban
          Silviculture Network, the Chesapeake Bay Forestry Workgroup, Forests in Cities, and other networks from local
          to national scales. Her research interests include urban tree physiology across different site types from
          forested natural areas to street tree pits; processes of forest restoration and regeneration in urban areas;
          historical trajectories of urban forests; urban forest inventory and analysis (Urban FIA); and motivations for
          community engagement with urban green spaces. Nancy has a Bachelors Degree in History and Biology from
          Stanford University, a Masters in Conservation Biology from Columbia University, and a PhD in Plant Science

      <h4>Growing Resilient Trees and Urban Forests Through Standards of Care</h4>
      <h5>Richard Hauer - Director of Urban Forestry at Eocene Environmental Group and Professor Emeritus of Urban
        Forestry at the University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point</h5>
      <p class="description">Growing trees to become centurions can occur by happenstance, but planning and putting tree
        care standards into practice increases the odds of success. Standards of Practice such as with the ANSI A300
        Tree Care Standards provide a process to write a specification, which we will explore through two common
        practices such as tree planting and tree pruning. To start, Should you or Shall you do something? Terms have
        meanings and Standards with actions lead to positive tree outcomes. Shall suggests something you must do. While
        Should suggests a recommendation that while not mandatory is really something you should have a good reason to
        explain why you did not take action. This talk will delve into standards of care with trees and their importance
        to promote resilient urban forests.</p>

      <p class="description">Listening and Learning from the Forest – New trees are not growing in many city forests.
        Planting in natural areas that already have an existing forest is expensive, carries environmental costs, and
        poses ecological risks. Yet, we need to close canopy gaps in existing urban forests and have young trees grow to
        replace those that die. Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is an alternative approach to planting trees that
        addresses the factors preventing regeneration so a forest can regrow. Join the Langdon Park Forest Stewards for
        this on-site visit to Langdon Park Forest Patch in northeast DC to see this method in action. After 4 years of
        ANR, there are over 2,000 tagged native tree seedlings representing 18 species.</p>
